My personal YT Timestamps to cue file converter used to manage my personal local music collection

## Features

- **Flexible Timestamp Parsing**: Supports multiple timestamp formats including `MM:SS`, `HH:MM:SS`, with or without brackets/parentheses
- **Interactive Metadata Collection**: Prompts for album name, artist, genre, year, and audio file details
- **Track Preview and Confirmation**: Review parsed tracks before generating the final CUE file
- **Standards Compliant**: Generates CUE sheets conforming to the CDRWIN CUE sheet specification
- **UTF-8 Support**: Handles international characters in track titles and metadata
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed input with helpful error messages

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system
3. Make the script executable (Unix/Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x youtube_to_cue.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python3 youtube_to_cue.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Prepare Timestamps File**: Create a text file containing timestamps and track titles
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script and provide the path to your timestamps file
3. **Review Tracks**: Confirm that the parsed tracks are correct
4. **Enter Metadata**: Provide album information (artist, album name, genre, etc.)
5. **Generate CUE File**: The script creates a `.cue` file ready for use

### Supported Timestamp Formats

The converter recognizes various timestamp formats commonly used in YouTube descriptions:

```
0:00 Track Title
00:00 Track Title
0:00:00 Track Title
[0:00] Track Title
(0:00) Track Title
1. 0:00 Track Title
Track Title [0:00]
Track Title (0:00)
```

### Example Input File

Create a text file (e.g., `timestamps.txt`) with your track listing:

```
0:00 Intro
3:45 First Track - Artist Name
7:23 Second Track (Extended Mix)
12:00 Third Track
[15:30] Fourth Track
18:45 Final Track
```

### Example Session

```

### Example Output

The generated CUE file will look like:

```cue
REM GENRE "Electronic"
REM DATE 2024
REM COMMENT "Generated by YouTube to CUE Converter"
PERFORMER "Various Artists"
TITLE "Summer Mix 2024"
FILE "summer_mix.mp3" WAVE
  TRACK 01 AUDIO
    TITLE "Intro"
    PERFORMER "Various Artists"
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    TITLE "First Track - Artist Name"
    PERFORMER "Various Artists"
    INDEX 01 03:45:00
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    TITLE "Second Track (Extended Mix)"
    PERFORMER "Various Artists"
    INDEX 01 07:23:00
```

## CUE File Format

The generated CUE sheets follow the standard CDRWIN CUE sheet format:

- **REM GENRE**: Music genre (optional)
- **REM DATE**: Release year (optional)
- **REM COMMENT**: Generation note
- **PERFORMER**: Album artist
- **TITLE**: Album title
- **FILE**: Referenced audio file
- **TRACK**: Individual track entries with title, performer, and index point

## Use Cases

- Creating CUE sheets for DJ mixes and podcasts
- Splitting long audio files into individual tracks
- Organizing music collections with proper metadata
- Preparing audio for CD burning with track markers
- Converting YouTube timestamp descriptions into playable formats

## Error Handling

The script handles common errors gracefully:

- **File Not Found**: Prompts to retry with a valid file path
- **Invalid Timestamps**: Warns about malformed lines and skips them
- **No Valid Tracks**: Alerts if no timestamps were successfully parsed
- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Clean exit on Ctrl+C

## Limitations

- Frames are always set to `00` as YouTube timestamps don't include sub-second precision
- All tracks are assigned the same performer (album artist) by default
- The FILE directive always uses `WAVE` format regardless of actual audio file type
